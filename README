What is Open Food Market?

Open Food Market is a GUI version of Food Market. 
using C++ as a primary language and wxWidgets 
with faster performance and cross-platform

the older version (1.0 until 3.0) uses Windows Batch File
and Text based interface


Why using wxWidgets?

Well, the reason is that wxWidgets is cross-platform  
and native across-devices, so every component will look exactly  
like the system does  


How to install?

Make sure you have all of the dependencies installed.
to install wxWidgets you can read the documentation
on the official site on how to install wxWidgets
on your system

if you want use to the Makfile and use a custom compilers
make sure to modify the Makefile and flags.
but I recommend to use GNU C++ Compiler (g++)

o LINUX :
	if you use "ubuntu based" distro, you can follow this easily
	i don't know if this will work on another based distro (arch, ect) 
	if you want to use g++ just install build-essential
	it includes GNU Compiler Collection (gcc, g++, ...)
	and make utility to compile the program
	so what you need?
		o build-essential
		o libgtk-3-dev (im not sure if you need this)
	after that, go to folder where you extract this and
	run 'make'

What is Open Food Market?

Open Food Market is a GUI version of Food Market. 
using C++ as a primary language and wxWidgets 
with faster performance and cross-platform

the older version (1.0 until 3.0) uses Windows Batch File
and Text based interface


Why using wxWidgets?

Well, the reason is that wxWidgets is cross-platform
and native across-devices, so every component will look exactly
like the system does


NOTE

Makefile is coming soon

or you can use this command to compile the source
g++ src/main.cpp `wx-config --cxxflags --libs std` -Iinclude -o ./bin/<debug or release>/main

but first you need to create this directory

bin/
bin/debug/ or bin/release/
